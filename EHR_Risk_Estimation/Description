The BCSC Risk Estimation dataset includes information from 2,392,998 screening mammograms of women without a prior breast cancer diagnosis and no breast imaging in the past 9 months, though they had a mammogram in the previous 5 years. Each case is linked with cancer registry and pathology data to identify breast cancer occurrence within one year of the screening.
To maintain privacy and reduce size, the data is aggregated into 280,660 records based on unique combinations of risk factors and outcomes, with a count for each. Personally identifiable information, dates, locations, and assessment results have been excluded to ensure confidentiality.
